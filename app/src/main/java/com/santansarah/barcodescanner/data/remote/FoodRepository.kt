    /**
     * In my repository, all I need to do is return the flow of either a LoadResult.Page
     * or LoadResult.Error from my PagingSource load function. You do this by configuring
     * a Pager instance. Here are some notes about PagingConfig:
     * 1. I already know that I have 24 items per page; the Api has already done
     *    this for me on the server. Out of the 24, about 5 products are visible on the
     *    screen at a time.
     * 2. I've read the docs for PagingConfig, and played around with the settings, and
     *    honestly, I don't really understand how they are working behind the scenes. For me,
     *    they don't seem to be working the way that I've read & understood the settings. Here's
     *    what I can tell you:
     *    - When you set pageSize, the prefetchDistance & initialLoadSize parameters are then
     *      derived from this value by default, if you don't set them specifically.
     *    - If you set the prefetchDistance to a number 2x's or more than the pageSize, it
     *      impacts how many pages are loaded in the initial fetch too, and from what I can
     *      tell, this seems true no matter what you have set for initialLoadSize.
     *  3. What the docs did help me realize was that I was getting 2 pages in my initial fetch,
     *     before the results were even displayed for the user. The Api that I'm using takes
     *     a few seconds to come back, so this wasn't optimal for my User Experience. At the same
     *     time though, I didn't want my users to see a bunch of 'loading more records' shimmers
     *     while they scrolled through the results either. By setting my pageSize to 6, my
     *     initialLoadSize to 1, and my prefectDistance to 12, I get just 1 page on my initial
     *     fetch, and it gets more after I scroll past the 7th product. I don't fully understand
     *     why yet - but this seems to be the perfect balance for my app, and the product list
     *     seems to render just fine, with all 24 in each page.
     * 4. By default, my maxSize is set to MAX_SIZE_UNBOUNDED, which means that no pages are dropped
     *    in memory. So far, this seems to be working great - I haven't had a crash ðŸ¤ž.
     * I encourage you to look at each of these settings and play around; writing out debug
     * info to Logcat definitely helps in situations like this. If your Api is fast, setting the
     * pageSize alone might be just fine for your needs.
