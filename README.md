## UX Optimized Search Field in Jetpack Compose: FocusManager, InteractionSource, KeyboardOptions

Today I’m going to talk about how to build a UX optimized search field with Jetpack Compose. This
Search field integrates various details that take time to program into our apps, but make all the
difference when it comes to keeping our users happy and coming back.

## UX cont...: Use Coil and Jetpack Compose Animations for Long API Calls

This video is all about animating colors, creating shimmers, scaling icons, and using Coil to handle
image requests. When you’re dealing with long API calls and it’s imperative that your app appears
responsive while it’s doing work in the background, animations can be an absolute must for creating
great User Experiences.

## Retrofit, Paging 3, and Jetpack Compose UX Error Handling

Handling errors gracefully and responsively is key to creating a great User Experience. A simple
snack bar might work in some cases, but if you need more functionality, don't hesitate to go the
extra mile - your users will appreciate it.

This was my greatest challenge yet! Check out my journey with machine learning for Android
and Jetpack Compose. I'll go through getting started, my attempts at a user to item recommendation
system, my final TensorFlow Lite model written in Colab, Firebase ML integration, Android dependencies, 
and my Jetpack Compose integration for recommending similar items.
